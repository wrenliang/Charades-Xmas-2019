## About
This is a fun project I worked on over winter break for our annual Christmas party. Charades is a bilingual app to simplify the preparation process for setting up a classic Charades game. Instead of handwriting cards or buying a Charades deck, simply put your desired words (and any translations) into the app's Words data structure, and easily make your own customizable, updateable Charades games!
