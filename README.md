## About
This is a fun project I worked on over winter break for our annual Christmas party. Charades is a bilingual app to simplify the preparation process for setting up a classic Charades game. Instead of handwriting cards or buying a Charades deck, simply put your desired words (and any translations) into the app's Words data structure, and easily make your own customizable Charades games!

## App Architecture
- Charades was built using the Model-View-Controller design pattern without the use of any Storyboards.
- All the UIViews were programmed using a constraints-based approach to allow for maximum UI customization. 
- Because Charades was developed natively in Swift, the app supports full Screen reader functionality.

Side Note: The Root ViewController of the app is a TabBarController in order to support the addition of multiple tabs easily if needed. (For now it is hidden because we only have one tab)
